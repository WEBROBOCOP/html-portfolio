<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I always envisioned my dream as becoming an instrumentation and control engineer, working on an offshore platform in the oil and gas industryâ€”conducting tests and making repairs for instrumentation tools. This dream seemed fitting with my Higher Diploma in Instrumentation and Control Engineering. However, after three years in the industry, I took a leap into the hospitality sector. There, I discovered a passion for customer service, human resources, and staff training. Despite being versatile in marketing, business management, budgeting, complaint resolution, and compliance, I couldn't shake a sense of indifference. I yearned to learn more, something different.

  The missing spark ignited when I clicked play on my first HTML tutorial video. My passion for coding came alive as I executed commands according to instructions. To further my education, I applied for a Computer Science BSc at Customs and Finance Dnipro, Ukraine, in May 2021. Unfortunately, a war broke out in February 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine, marking the largest attack on a European country since World War II. However, this is a story for another day.
  
  Fast forward to my arrival in Germany, where I worked with Tesla Gigafactory. Leveraging skills acquired as an instrumentation and control engineer and hospitality manager, I delved into the renewable energy-saving industry. This diverse experience shaped my knowledge.
  
  Currently, I'm back to my coding spark, on a roadmap to becoming a DevOps engineer. My expertise includes rapidly acquiring new skills and programming languages, problem-solving, domain-driven design, responsive design principles, website optimization, and proficiency in the Model View Model (MVVM) and Model View Controller (MVC) methods of code organization. I've mastered C#, .Net Framework, SQL, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, Angular, and Git/GitHub. Enthusiastically, I'm embracing any programming languages, frameworks, or principles that can enhance the web of code in my mind.
  
  My personal abilities include:
  
  - Strong motivational and leadership skills
  - Excellent logical, analytical, and computational skills
  - The ability to work confidently within a group
  - Effective communication with clients and team members
  - Thriving in a high-pressure environment
  - Multitasking
  - Quick learning and grasping of new concepts
  - A good sense of humor</p>
